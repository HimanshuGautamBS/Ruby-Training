*Boolean operators* are really methods which means that they have return values. 

true in a Ruby program is an instance of => TrueClass, 
while every appearance of false is an instance of =>  FalseClass.

=>String is one type of data that are truthy.

# !! (double bang operator)
  =>name="hello"
 
 >> name.class
 => String

 >> !name
 => false

 >> !!name
 => true

*In Ruby there are three main boolean operators:

1)!  ("single bang") which represents NOT
2)&& ("double-ampersand") which represents "AND"
3)|| ("double-pipe") which represents "OR"

 >> A=TRUE
 (irb):33: warning: constant ::TRUE is deprecated
 => true

 >> A
 => true

 >> !A
 => false

 >> B=TRUE
 (irb):36: warning: constant ::TRUE is deprecated
 => true

 >> B
 => true

 >> A
 => true

 >> A==B
 => true

 >> A!=B
 => false

 >> A.class==B.class
 => true

 >> A.class
 => TrueClass

 >> A.class && B.class == TrueClass
 => true
